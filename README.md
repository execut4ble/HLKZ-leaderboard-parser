# HLKZ-leaderboard-parser
Originally it would fetch the maplist file on it's own, but that required FTP access so I it in this version and left a maplist file of my own; it might be incomplete as there are new maps being completed and new leaderboards being created as a result.

If reading local files, you will need to place them in the "data" folder (in the same directory as the program), as well as a proper maplist file.
